## 📖 About
This is my version of the classic Pong game, developed during [Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://www.edx.org/learn/game-development/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-game-development) course, where I learned the fundamentals of game development, programming concepts using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) language and some features of the [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org) framework.
